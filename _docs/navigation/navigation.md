title: Navigation
lead: Allows users to move between pages of content within the site.

1. **Main Navigation:** Contained within the [header](http://gsa.github.io/openIAE/sam_web_standards/components/#header) and [footer](http://gsa.github.io/openIAE/sam_web_standards/components/#footer) components, available on the majority (all) of the pages. From a front-end user perspective, this results in a change from transition.SAM.gov to something like transition.SAM.gov/wages or transition.SAM.gov/about/legal.
2. **Category Navigation:** Appended to the header area and provides navigation within a primary are of the site (transition.SAM.gov/systeminformaiton); thereby, allowing each primary page to have sub-pages (“Due to Be Revised” within Wages, for example).
3. **Side Navigation (up to three levels):** Navigation appearing in a vertical sidebar along the left side of pages using the [Side Navigation](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/sidenav/) component from the *US Web Standards*. This type of navigation should be avoided, if possible or practical. Further, if possible, only one level of navigation will make it easier for a front-end user to navigate.
