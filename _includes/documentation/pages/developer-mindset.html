<h2 class="usa-heading" id="bandwidth"> Bandwidth and Processor Speeds</h2>

The *SAM Web Standards* recommends a [mobile first]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/visual-style/#mobile-first) approach to design and development. As part of this recommendation it is important to consider bandwidth constraints, caps of data plans, and processor speeds. Therefore, it is recommended that the majority of processes be performed server-side while delivering the minimum data required to the client-side to update a user. Further, mobile and tablet devices typically have less processing power and hardware resources available, which should also be taken into consideration when creating client-side scripts.

### Secure by Default

There are two transfer protocols used to serve Web content: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTP Secure (HTTPS). By default all uniform resource locators (URLs) should use HTTPS; an HTTP URL should redirect to the HTTPS equivalent.


### No WWW

URLs should not require the use of “www”, as this represents a sub-domain and could lead to confusion if subdomains are implemented on the site. In other words, there is a question of whether the following are different sites or the same:

* https://www.my.domainname.com
* https://my.www.domainname.com
* https://my.domainname.com

### Human-Friendly and Readable

URLs should be case-*insensitive*; therefore, the following URL pairs should result in the display of the same content:

* https://My.DomainName.com and<br>https://my.domainname.com
* https://my.DomainName.com/MainPage/SubPage and<br>https://my.domainname.com/mainpage/subpage
* https://my.domainname.com/AFileOnTheServer.pdf and<br>https://my.domainname.com/afileontheserver.pdf

This allows communication and marketing collateral to be built in a more human-readable manner by using upper- and lower-case letters to separate words within URLs while supporting copy and paste of the URL into a browser.

Further, when developing page addresses and URLs a user should be able to gain a basic understanding of what they will see, for example:

* https://domainname.com/mainpage/posts/descriptive-post-title
* not https://domainname.com/?page=1&post=5

## Feature switches

A feature switch allows you to begin development of a feature, but only have it available in certain environments. Therefore, new features can be merged into the master codebase without negatively impacting continuous integration or deployment.
